This module will install and bootstrap the driveclient agent and start the driveclient service.\r\n\r\n## Module Installation\r\n\r\n* Add the 'cloudbackup' folder into your module path\r\n* Include the class and configure the relevant variables for your Rackspace Cloud Backup account:\r\n* __username__ - your rackspace cloud username\r\n* __api_key__ - found under Your Account > API Access here: https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/APIAccess.do\r\n\r\n### EXAMPLE\r\n\r\n```puppet\r\nclass { 'cloudbackup':\r\n  username => 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',\r\n  api_key  => 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Build Status\r\nThe build should satisfy the following:\r\n\r\n* puppet-lint tests\r\n* rspec tests defined under the rspec dir\r\n\r\nThe current status is: \r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/avatarnewyork/puppet-cloudbackup.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/avatarnewyork/puppet-cloudbackup)\r\n\r\n## ToDo\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there isn't an API available for CloudBackup so there isn't a whole lot more that can be done with this module.  Hopefully down the road they open up an API that will allow configuration, scheduling, restores, etc but for now that all must be done from the Rackspace Control Panel","google":"UA-86949-53"}
